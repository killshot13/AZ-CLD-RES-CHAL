_Instructions:_ Follow [steps 1-16](https://killshot13.github.io/azure-cloud-resume-challenge), in order, without skipping any stages or choosing to dabble only with the sections that seem most fun or interesting.

Why? Because after completing the [Azure Cloud Resume Challenge](https://killshot13.github.io/azure-cloud-resume-challenge) from start to finish, you will already have more useful skills than a lot of people who graduate from university computer science programs.

More specifically, you will understand something about full-stack software development, version control, infrastructure as code, automation, continuous integration and delivery, cloud services and “serverless”, application security, and networking.

Most importantly, you will have demonstrated the number-one skill in a cloud engineer’s toolbox: the ability to learn fast and Google new terminology with precision.

And you’ll have learned by doing, because the instructions aren't specific enough to figure anything out without going down some dark, lengthy rabbit holes.

Alternatively, if you give this project a try and realize that you hate it, or you’re just not interested, you’ll have learned a valuable lesson about whether a career in the cloud is truly for you – because these are the types of problems that real cloud engineers and developers really work on every day.
